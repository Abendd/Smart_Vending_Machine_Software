There are a number of issues and problems faced by specially abled beings due to which they feel alienated.For example if they want to use a certain vending machine in a public place they might feel a bit inconvinient & dependent on others for simple day to day tasks. So for even simple tasks, if there is nobody around they might feel helpless and there is no choice left for them either to leave that task or wait for someone to help them out.

From what we have recognized whenever a specially abled person is trying to use a vending machine Interface he/she faces difficulty in using even the most simplest interfaces for normal people.When we talk about any automated system our first aim is to provide people an easy interface accessable by all which we see lacking in the normal vending machines or any commonly used software.

We aim to provide an easy Software Interface for specially abled, to allow them to use any vending machine or any other software that has an user interaction with minimal or no help required to perform any task.
